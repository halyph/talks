                | As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was
                |surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little
                |white kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done
                |that?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up
                |and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,
                |as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,
                |and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the
                |cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it
                |hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
                |
                |`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice , a good deal frightened at
                |the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in
                |existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed
                |back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut
                |again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
                |before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,
                |`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare
                |it's too bad, that it is!'
                |
                |  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another
                |moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  Her first
                |idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that
                |case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  ( Alice had
                |been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general
                |conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find
                |a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in
                |the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and
                |behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that
                |she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine
                |feet high.
